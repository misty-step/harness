# Setup mistystack

Model and reasoning choices belong in the active harness's native authority, not
a second roster in method prose. One root `skills/` tree and `rules/core.md`
supply the method to every adapter.

1. **Detect.** Establish the active session's harness, native version and target
   profile/home from the runtime itself. An installed executable alone does not
   identify the active harness. If configuring a different destination, name it
   explicitly and keep every operation in that destination's scope. Read the
   matching note before writing:

   | Harness | Native mechanics |
   | --- | --- |
   | OMP | [OMP](../misty/harnesses/omp.md) |
   | Claude Code | [Claude Code](../misty/harnesses/claude.md) |
   | Codex | [Codex](../misty/harnesses/codex.md) |
   | pi | [pi](../misty/harnesses/pi.md) |
   | Grok Bot: Maren or Shipwright | [Grok Bot self-install brief](../misty/harnesses/grok-bot.md) |

   **Complete when:** the runtime, version, destination scope and matching native
   contract are known; Grok-specific mechanisms are established by the bots, not
   inferred from another harness.

2. **Inspect and install.** Read existing native settings, plugin/package state,
   role definitions and relevant project/user overrides. Follow the note's native
   install or refresh path, including any required hook trust. Preserve unrelated
   configuration, agents, plugins, credentials and runtime data; merge owned
   entries instead of replacing whole files. Never copy live credentials into a
   scratch proof home. Inspect the installed artifact after refresh rather than
   assuming the catalog or an unchanged version means the files are current.
   **Complete when:** the intended artifact is installed in the intended scope,
   core/skill wiring is configured, and foreign state is preserved. This is not
   yet live loading proof.

3. **Choose.** Read [roles.md](../ship-loop/roles.md#rigor) for the tier and required
   responsibilities. Inspect the active harness's accessible models, supported
   reasoning levels and existing assignments without exposing credentials. A
   catalog entry or shipped template is not proof of provider entitlement. Keep
   usable existing choices; carry settled budget choices forward; ask for missing
   budget or provider choices together. The matching note's dispatch and rigor
   section says what is assignable in that harness, including harnesses that run
   rigor inline. Grok Bots must first establish their native capability and model
   authority.
   **Complete when:** every applicable native assignment uses an accessible model
   and supported reasoning setting, and the required independent execution path
   is identified rather than simulated with an inline self-review.

4. **Persist through native authority.** Apply and read back only the selected
   harness's owned assignments, exactly as its note's dispatch and rigor section
   describes: [OMP](../misty/harnesses/omp.md#dispatch-and-rigor),
   [Claude Code](../misty/harnesses/claude.md#dispatch-and-rigor),
   [Codex](../misty/harnesses/codex.md#dispatch-and-rigor),
   [pi](../misty/harnesses/pi.md#rigor-inline-without-subagents),
   [Grok Bot](../misty/harnesses/grok-bot.md). Prove an unfamiliar config
   mechanism in an isolated home first ([OMP recipe](agents.md)).
   **Complete when:** native readback matches the chosen assignments and any
   shadowing is resolved explicitly. Readback proves persistence, not provider
   access or successful inference.

5. **Prove a fresh destination session.** Follow the matching note's consumer
   proof. Retain runtime version, candidate revision, install/config results and
   actual events showing the core loaded, installed Misty was discovered/read,
   and its relative bug-fix link reached the installed playbook. Check principle
   discovery policy and explicit reachability separately. Where native rigor
   agents exist, prove their discovery and a short authorized dispatch with actual
   agent/model identity and result. In pi, prove the main-session path instead;
   for Grok Bot, require separate fresh-runtime proof from Maren and Shipwright.
   **Complete when:** the claimed consumer path has observed evidence. Report
   no-model installation and file/config readback as `artifact verified`, not live
   behavior proven; name missing inference, browser or dispatch proof explicitly.

Re-running setup reconciles the same owned native entries. Retire an entry only
after its callers migrate; never remove unrelated configuration or credentials.
